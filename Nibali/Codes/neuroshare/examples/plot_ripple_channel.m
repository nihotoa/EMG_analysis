function plot_ripple_channel(hFile, port, headstage, channel)
% PLOT_RIPPLE_CHANNEL Produce three panel plot for Ripple channel
% This function provides an easy interface to plot spike waveforms,
% spike times, and analog wave forms for the given Ripple channel
%
% Usage: ns_RESULT = plot_ripple_channel(hFile, port, headstage, channel)
%   Parameters:
%       hFile - Neuroshare file handle (returned from ns_OpenFile)
%       port - single character that should be 'a' - 'd'
%       headstage - index of headstage used
%       channel - index of channel wanted relative to the headstage.
% See also PLOT_RIPPLE_SPIKE, PLOT_RIPPLE_HIST, PLOT_RIPPLE_ANALOG
