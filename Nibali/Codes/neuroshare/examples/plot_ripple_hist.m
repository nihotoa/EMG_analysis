function plot_ripple_hist(hFile, port, headstage, channel, varargin)
%PLOT_RIPPLE_HIST Plot spike data using Grapevine port ids
% that translate easily to Ripple Grapevine NIP ports and headstages.
% 
% Usage: ns_RESULT = plot_ripple_hist(hFile, port, headstage, channel)
%   Parameters:
%       hFile - Neuroshare file handle (returned from ns_OpenFile)
%       port - single character that should be 'a' - 'd'
%       headstage - index of headstage used
%       channel - index of channel wanted relative to the headstage.
