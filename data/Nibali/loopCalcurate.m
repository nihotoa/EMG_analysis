how to use
please set current dir as 'MATLAB -> data -> Nibali'
[function]
Use another function with using loop
[procedure]
pre: none
post: please refer the text of 'untitled.m' or 'SensorCenteredEMG.m'
[caution!!!]
if you conduct ' Copy_of_sample_data_walkthrough.m', please remove the path of 'MATLAB' → 'Code' and set the path of 'MATLAB' → 'Nibali'
