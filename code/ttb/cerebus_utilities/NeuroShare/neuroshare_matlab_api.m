% Neuroshare Matlab Application Programming Interface
% 
%  
% 
% The Neuroshare Matlab import functions allow users to easily import neural data files into Matlab for further analysis. These functions were developed as part of an SBIR program funded by the National Institute for Neural Disorders and Stroke and it is currently being administered by Cyberkinetics, Inc. (formerly Bionic Technologies, LLC).  The goals of the SBIR program are to create open Application Programming Interface (API) library and format standards for neurophysiological experiment data and create a set of free, open-source software tools for low-level handling and processing of neurophysiological data.

% Version History
% 
% Version 2.2:      Added:
% 
% ns_SetLibrary: A function to specify which DLL to use for future commands
% 
%  
% 
% Version 2.1:      Bug fixes:
% 
% E        ns_GetNeuralInfo & ns_GetSegmentData: Units classified as enoisef are now loaded in with the right unit ID.
% 
% E        nsNEVLibrary.dll: The sample group packets are counted correctly (previously occasionally returned 0). Simultaneously saved NEV experimental data packets are read in the correct time order. Entities with no data are included with an ItemCount of zero.
% 
% Software was compiled with Matlab Version 6.1.
% 
% Version 2.0:      Bug fixes:
% 
% E        ns_GetLibraryInfo: Function returns the correct structure; some items were swapped before.
% 
% E        ns_GetNeuralData: Function does not return all zeros anymore as timestamps when one of the input argumentsf indices is invalid.
% 
% E        ns_GetSegmentData: Function now returns the correct values when data is imported for the second time.
% 
% E        Library now works with all Matlab versions 6.x and should not return the gInvalid mex-fileh error message when loading the library.
% 
% Returned structures do not use Hungarian notation anymore in variable / field names (e.g. changed from eszEntityLabelf to eEntityLabelf and edwItemCountf to eItemCountf).
% 
% Continuous analog data files for sample groups of the Cerebus system (*.nsx files) can now be imported together with their *.nev files.
% 
% Software was compiled with Matlab Version 6.1.
% 
% Version 1.1:      Bug fixes:
% 
% E        ns_GetAnalogInfo does not cause a segmentation fault anymore.
% 
% Software was compiled with Matlab Version 6.5.
% 
%  
% 
% Version 1.0:      This is the first implementation of the Matlab API that conforms to the Neuroshare API Specification 1.0.
% 
% Software was compiled with Matlab Version 6.5.
% 
%  
% 
% Installation of the Matlab API
% 
% The API consists of the following files:
% 
% mexprog.dll
% 
% ns_SetLibrary.m
% 
% ns_GetLibraryInfo.m
% 
% ns_OpenFile.m
% 
% ns_GetFileInfo.m
% 
% ns_CloseFile.m
% 
% ns_GetEntityInfo.m
% 
% ns_GetEventInfo.m
% 
% ns_GetEventData.m
% 
% ns_GetAnalogInfo.m
% 
% ns_GetAnalogData.m
% 
% ns_GetSegmentInfo.m
% 
% ns_GetSegmentSourceInfo.m
% 
% ns_GetSegmentData.m
% 
% ns_GetNeuralInfo.m
% 
% ns_GetNeuralData.m
% 
% ns_GetIndexByTime.m
% 
% ns_GetTimeByIndex.m
% 
% ns_GetLastErrorMsg.m
% 
% There is no installation program but the files should be installed in the following locations:
% 
% mexprog.dll ? The mexprog.dll file should either be in the same directory as the m?scripts or they should be on the Matlab path.
% 
% m-scripts ? The m-scripts should be on the Matlab path or in the current working directory.
% 
%  
% 
% In addition to the aboved named files, you will also need to obtain a Neuroshare Library from your instrument vendor. This DLL can be placed anywhere on your system. It is easiest if you place the Vendor Neuroshare DLL in the same directory as the m-scripts; otherwise, you will need to know its location for the ns_SetLibrary function call.
% 
%  
% 
% Many of the vendor Neuroshare DLLs can be obtained from www.neuroshare.org.
% 
% Representation of Data Types
% 
% There are 17 different functions that allow the user to import certain parts of the data file or to search the data file for specific events. Neural data is divided into four basic categories or gEntity Typesh:
% 
% Event Entities ? Discrete events that consist of small time-stamped text or binary data packets.  These are used to represent data such as trial markers, experimental events, digital input values, and embedded user comments.
% 
% Analog Entities ? Continuous, sampled data that represent digitized analog signals such as position, force, and other experiment signals, as well as electrode signals such as EKG, EEG and extracellular microelectrode recordings.
% 
% Segment Entities ? Short, time-stamped segments of digitized analog signals in which the segments are separated by variable amounts of time.  Segment Entities can contain data from more than one source. They are intended to represent discontinuous analog signals such as extracellular spike waveforms from electrodes or groups of electrodes.
% 
% Neural Event Entities ? Timestamps of event and segment entitities that are known to represent neural action potential firing times.  For example, if a segment entity contains sorted neural spike waveforms, each sorted unit is also exported as a neural entity.
% 
% The API definition also provides functions for querying information about data files and the entities contained in the data file.  This information includes labels, metric units, timings, etc.
% 
% Structure of File Data
% 
% Data entities in a data file are enumerated by the library from 1 to (total number of entities).  This is different than the enumeration of the similar C++ Neuroshare API.  The enumeration was changed because, in contrast to C++, all arrays in Matlab start at one.  Each entity is one of the four types discussed in the Representation of Dates Types section above and there are no requirements for ordering entities by type.
% 
% Each entity contains one or more indexed data entries that are ordered by increasing time.  The API provides functions for querying the characteristics of the file, the number of entities, and the characteristics of each entity, including the number of indexes for each entity.
% 
% The structure of the indexed data entries for each entity depends on the entity type:
% 
% Each index of an event entity refers to a timestamp and data combination. The number of indexes is equal to the number of event entries for that event entity in the data file.
% 
% Each index of an analog entity refers to a specific digitized sample.  Each analog entity contains samples from a single channel and the number of indexes is equal to the number of samples present for that channel.
% 
% Each index of a segment entity refers to a short, time-stamped segment of analog data from one or more sources.  The number of indexes is equal to the number of entries for that segment entity in the file.
% 
% Each index of a neural event entity refers to a timestamp for each neural event.  Each neural event entity contains event times for a single neural source.  The number of indexes is equal to the number of entries for that neural event entity.
